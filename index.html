<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Finding one's way in machine learning and deep learning. </em></strong></h2>
<p>About 4 years ago, while reflecting on a topic, what I should dedicate my current reincarnation to, I came up with what seems simple and straightforward idea <strong><em>Add some knowledge and profit for humankind and push transhumanism. </em></strong>While the goal doesn't sound S.M.A.R.T (specific, measurable, &hellip;), its main purpose was to define at least some ultimate criteria for me to decide -what activities I'd rather engage and spend my limited lifetime on, and which doesn't worth it.</p>
<p>After 4 years of studying and working in area which marketers call A.I., managers - machine (or deep) learning and engineers do by sklearn/pytorch/keras I'm slowly coming to conclusion the initial goal is no so easy achievable in the area partially due to reasons far beyond technical limitations.</p>
<p>One of examples - during the start of my journey I was excited I'll be able to work on technologies like a self-driving car, and really improve the people lives around the world by saving millions hours, they spend on driving and some lives. Looking now at the development of the topic - I can observe - while 4-5 years ago was quite clear, that main metric of safety of such a vehicles should be number of causalities by 10^8 or 10^9 miles and once they will outperform humans at this dimension they have to be widely adopted and this will allow saving thousands of lives per year [1].<br />However, nowadays if you look at public discourse - no one even tries to measure it, but once accident happens - mainstream news are flooded with the vivid description of how terrible the accident was and how irresponsible to let technology go ahead, without any attempt to refer to above metric. While trying to gather any single source of information for such a statistics is extremely hard, and one have to look for it much further than first several pages of search engine. To get some estimate I had to combine information from various sources, like [2] and [3] and no one trying to reflect on that numbers in public discussions anymore (by the way, data suggests technology is safer than human drivers and can therefor save lives).</p>
<p>What are points of public discourse now, expect trying to persuade people that autonomous cars are dangerous by colorfully depicting accidents - are</p>
<ol>
  <li>&ldquo;mass loses of jobs&rdquo;, where jobs are considered to be worthful of its one sake, even if doing this jobs have negative impact on society as a whole. There are deep sociological roots of such an issue, but I'd better address you to David Graeber &ldquo;Bullshit jobs&rdquo; , who is doing much better than me in describing phenomena.</li>
  <li>not ready insurance and legislation frameworks to deal with self-driving cars, which seems taken out of political agenda thanks to the &ldquo;job loss potential&rdquo; of the technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another example is definitely medical application, where algorithms can provide at least diagnostic services, to people, simply don't have access to them due to economic reasons. As far as I can understand the issue - whole medicine is busy inventing millions of technical and ethical reasons, why it shouldn't be done, and while I haven't done more deep dive into this domain, I can assume that reasons behind this again more economical, political and social much more the technological.<br />The most sad story there is tremendous amount of &ldquo;ethics specialists&rdquo;, &ldquo;think tanks&rdquo; thriving on governmental money are not concentrating at what is not being done, but neatpicking slips of currently working technologies. While some of them have point, still it seems to me example of availability heuristics, which causes that instead of whistleblowing that we are loosing time and efforts on not saving lives, could be saved, they are concerned about gender biases in language models and &ldquo;debiasing&rdquo; them (which doesn't have to much effect, until society itself will get debiased, as for me).</p>
<p>However, my goal there is not &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; the society, while raising awareness of state of affair can actually contribute towards this agenda, but pursuing my abovementioned goal, and keep trying in finding best, or, at least, good enough points of application for my effort. In order to do this I essentially had to answer several orthogonal questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>what DL technologies are capable of in general</li>
  <li>which projects/activities/organizations are exists in the field, where my knowledge can be of any use</li>
  <li>which projects/activities/organizations I can join to extend capabilities of technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me try to approach those one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What technologies is capable of in general</h3>
<p>We, honestly speaking, don't know. What we do know - what can be done using existing technologies, but we don't have many ideas about the boundaries. While the progress slowed down a bit, still new stuff like GPT-3 keeps appearing, which suggests we're quite far from reaching the boundary at the current moment. Of course the problem of applying and deploying algorithms to actually make it produce some useful social value is not something I'm capable of solving, but I still can hope it just require time or crisis.</p>
<h3>Which projects/activities/organizations are exists in the field, where my knowledge can be of any use</h3>
<p>What partially the problem is - while GPT-2 could be yet reproduced by some private researcher [5], training GPT-3 model requires computation power far beyond any single researcher could obtain. Similar story is with gathering the data - while institutional players can, with some limitations, gather whatever data, it's far from being the case for single enthusiasts or grassroots communities. So, at the first glance, it's preferred direction and I even was pursuing it for some time. However, let's take a look, what's I've found so far.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAANG</span></h4>
<p>There is, of course, a lot of interesting engineering work in those, and I probably can get there, but this has nothing to do with machine learning and research in it. In machine learning though, as far as I understand it - the few things which are actually used the most are either for advertisement selling (and, for Facebook it makes most of its profit, and quit a lot for google) and there is not so much research around it, production models are mostly revolving around decision trees and linear models, partially due to constricting response time constraints, partially due to cost-benetit trade-offs, there is just no benefits of increasing accuracy for 5-10%, while increasing inference cost by 10-100 time using deep learning models. Another type of FAANG projects something like alpha zero in google deepmind. They are mostly sponsored from marketing budget (translating the message that &ldquo;if we can even win go champion, we definitely can sell your Ads the best way possible&rdquo;). Most of such projects are still quite interesting and has potential to develop something more useful than marketing buzz (while I haven't heard anything about usage of alpha zero project outcomes thus far), but there is much more competition in joining such projects, than in joining google in general. Most of the positions around promising research projects require moreover PhD or publications at &ldquo;top venues&rdquo;, which you can still make not being in academia, but it's a half-a-year project on its own [6]. And looking at the profile of author, who did this [7] I wouldn't say it's worked</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Open.ai</span></h4>
<p>Which is one more big player not part of FAANG and business model is quite unclear yet, so there is no clear answer what objectives they do pursuing. However, if this is sort of toy project of Elon Mask, this could be genuine research activities not strictly constrained by the revenue goals, while not poisoned by inefficiency of academia. Competition to join is yet probably comparable with projects like deepmind, and the one, not being US resident don't even has many chances to apply.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Academy</span></h4>
<p>In this part I've got a bit of personal experience as worked for a while for a start-up founded by academicians and was talked with plenty of guys from academia from various countries, to understand internal functioning of the system. At the begging of my journey that way was seemed most promising for me for the purpose of doing some impactful things. Of course, looking deeper showed up, reality is not that bright as a frontend. </p>
<p><img src="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a4R8rx1_700bwp.webp" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is plenty of shortcomings, while the most knows are &ldquo;publish or perish&rdquo; (which causes most of the research are picking low-hanging fruits, while not trying to approach more fundamental tasks, as it's just too risky not to publish within a time frame necessary amount of papers), filling grant applications (and ye, mostly grant providers actually deciding what to be researched, not researchers) and replacing senior colleagues on lecturing (just consuming time). This is the most activities, your PhD project actually will consist of. The less obvious, but more fundamental issue - academia is about slow climbing the ranking system, and the higher our ranking - the more freedom to choose your topics you have. So to get to some promising research directions and world class research one have to spend 10-20 years in doing almost non-sense. Which is not an issue, of course, if you're considering academic path during your degree, but for someone above 30 and worked most of your carrier in industry - it gives almost no chances not even invent something useful, but just to inventing. It's still could be not-that-bad option for the now students, to consider this path, but as I don't belong anymore to students, I'd finally had to abandon my attempts.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Start-ups</span></h4>
<p>Start-up landscape actually differs a lot from country to country. So, living in Europe, I can say, start-up can get venture funding only in case it's has already established business model (and therefor don't need funding too much). And again, most of the startups has a goal to generate revenues (money out of money), and not technological inventions.<br />Again, not having US residence, there is no chance for me even apply for those, as startups are almost never supporting the visas and use local stuffing. So, while this direction is slightly under investigated from my side, I don't see it worth time at this point.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Algorithmic trading</span></h4>
<p>I've just placed those guys a bit aside, as it's clear example, how ML/DL can be used for evil, not for good, and despite there is plenty of research coming on in this area, it definitely will not benefit anyone, expect company stakeholders.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medium size companies</span></h4>
<p>The one of I'm working for right now. Yes, we do use machine learning, and even some deep learning in our platform. This doesn't go too much beyond using already established algorithms and even code from open-source, as project planning is done solely based on return of investment criteria. So yes, I can apply algorithms already proven to be working in different settings to the company tasks, but it's again too much about increasing company profit (which quite reasonable, they're paying salaries from those profits at the end of the day). </p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kaggle</span></h4>
<p>Nice playground, definitely worth to play it to improve one's skills, but nowtimes kaggle is platform mostly to highlight one's skill in case of recruiting for regular ML/DS job, which I already have, and looking into some linkedin profiles of masters and grandmasters published, it doesn't seem to me they work on impactful things (while definitely have a decent salaries)</p>
<h3>Which projects/activities/organizations I can join to extend capabilities of technologies</h3>
<p>So, looking at various organizations and organizational forms, given my current country of residence (EU), citizenship (better not to say), age (above 30), no PhD and academia record track, there is simply no way to join any institutional project, making some impact. The only way left is doing something as independent researcher in a spare time from main job (as I have to still pay bill) or joining the some grassroot group doing the same. Doing something as individual is challenging for me, mostly in answering the question, which direction I can pursue on my own, most ideas coming to my mind up to date are already being worked on. Keep steadily dedicating time aside from job is either not that easy (but achievable, actually, I've learned most of ML this way and made a transition from software architect to machine learning programmer).<br />So, my hopes are in looking for and finally finding some communities, doing the projects, I'm interested in, and thanks to COVID, a lot of such came from being completely offline to the online ones (like machine learning Tokyo https://machinelearningtokyo.com/). This could, of course cause other challenges, I'm yet not aware of, but there is a hope, dealing with such challenges in a small group could be easier, then trying to find some way in behemoth academy or dealing with US visas system.</p>
